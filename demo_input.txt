Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. 
From healthcare and education to business and entertainment, AI is reshaping industries and redefining 
the way humans interact with machines. By using machine learning algorithms, natural language 
processing, and computer vision, AI enables machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make 
decisions with minimal human intervention. However, AI also raises ethical concerns related to 
privacy, job displacement, and bias in decision-making.
